this is the creation of a frontend interface for displaying, booking, updating and deleting a list of models fetched from the srver a list of models is fetched from the server and is looped through to create a card element for each model. this includes the model's image, name, availability,category and a set of buttons for booking the model, displaying a model's details, liking the model, updating the model's details and also deleting a model. when the "MODEL DETAILS" button is clicked, a new set of html elements is created and appended to the card to display the details of the model. When the "DELETE MODEL" button is clicked, a confirmation dialog appears, prompting the user to confirm if they want to delete the model or not. If the user confirms, the model will be deleted on the browser and on the server too. if the user clicks the "BOOK MODEL" button, a PATCH request is sent to the server to change the availability status of the model to "unavailable". The button is disabled and shows that the model is booked. When the "+1" button is clicked, the number of likes for the model is increased and displayed on the model's card. incase the user want to update the details of the model or change the model's details, the "UPDATE DETAIL" displays input fields for updating the model's details and beneath it, there is a "Save Changes" button that sents a PUT request to the server to update the details of the model in the database.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
